Hi!

My name is Josep Rodriguez, and I am a *Mobile Senior Software Engineer* who
strives for well crafted software, Continuous Integration and Continuous
Deployment to deliver value to organisations.

I'm originally from [Minorca](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=menorca&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOpqC2_7zSAhUIIMAKHZ_eABEQ_AUICCgB&biw=1210&bih=961),
but lived in Barcelona for 8 years, studying and working, before moving to London.

I focus in iOS application development, being also proficient in Android,
even though I have also worked in several other technologies:

* NodeJS backends
* PHP backends
* Eclipse RCP
* Front-end development using Bootstrap and JQuery

Apart from this breadth of technologies I've been involved in, I have experienced
the whole lifecycle of a project, from ideation, technical workshops, NFR gathering,
to releasing to the app store, and maintaining the product.

Feel free to check out my [Resume](/resume.html) or my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseprl89/) for further information.
