# Hi!

My name is Josep Rodriguez, and I am a *Mobile Senior Software Engineer* who
strives for well crafted software, and using Continuous Integration & Continuous
Deployment to deliver value to organisations.

I am originally from [Minorca](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=menorca&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOpqC2_7zSAhUIIMAKHZ_eABEQ_AUICCgB&biw=1210&bih=961),
but lived in Barcelona for 8 years, studying and working, before moving to London.

I focus in *iOS application development*, being also proficient in *Android*,
even though I have also worked in several other technologies:

* Back-end Software development
  * *NodeJS*
  * *LAMP* stack
  * *Java* servers
* *Eclipse RCP*
* Web development using *Bootstrap* and *JQuery*
* Mobile Cross platform development
  * *Xamarin*
  * Titanium Appcelerator

Apart from this breadth of technologies I have been involved in, I have experienced
the whole lifecycle of a project, from ideation, technical workshops, *NFR* gathering,
to releasing to the app store, and maintaining the product via continuous delivery allowing the business to perform lean experimentation.

Feel free to check out my [Resume](/resume.html), my [Portfolio](/portfolio), or my
