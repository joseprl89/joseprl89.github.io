## [By-Taxi (Driver & Passenger)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.techideas.taxi&hl=en)

By-Taxi is a taxi booking app like Uber developed in Barcelona. It was an in-house product
developed in an agency I worked for.

Apart from apps, we had to develop the required ecosystem to manage the service easily within a
small team.

## [Food2U](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bcnathome.food2u&hl=en)

A startup two coworkers created and I helped deliver using *Titanium Appcelerator*.

It was eventually bought by [Just-Eat](http://www.restauracionnews.com/just-eat-compra-la-plataforma-food2u/)
and the product was discontinued.

## Nuffield Healthscore

An app to track the health of the user and provide a score based on the user's behaviour
and input.

After inheriting the codebase from a different agency, we released two versions where:

* Reskinned the whole app with a better UI.
* Integrated with *Microsoft Band*
