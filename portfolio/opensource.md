## Open source

Not enough time to do any significant open source contributions, apart from minor
contributions here and there.

My last trial at creating an open source tool is [Archie](https://github.com/joseprl89/Archie).
The idea is to generate [C4 architecture](https://www.structurizr.com/help/c4) diagrams
from YAML files so as to reduce the time it takes to maintain architectural documents.
